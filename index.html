    <div class="text">We choose the theme *Children in Harms Way* and explore the solution pathway: A Community Voice!<br/>
      We expect to create a safety/emergency Service system that is built into various smart devices for children and an APP 
      for parents to change settings of our services.<br/>Our greatest innovation is connecting to all the members and 
      digital devices of the community so that anything close to the children in need can help!</div>
