    <div class="text">We choose the theme *Children in Harms Way* and explore the solution pathway: A Community Voice!<br/>
      Our solution is an app designed to be used by caregivers and children. It is intended to be used as an emergency signal 
      if a child is thought to be in danger by algorithms which utilise a smartphone/watch's built in sensors .
      <br/>Our greatest innovation is connecting to all members and 
      digital devices of the community so that anything close to the children in need can help!</div>
